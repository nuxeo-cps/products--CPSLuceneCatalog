New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  remove defunct entries and reindex any missing entries.
Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Added a workaround for Lucenes single-field reindexing problem.
New internal features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Now turns of asynchronous indexing when reindexing all proxies.
  Speeds up the zope side significantly, especially for single-field 
  indexing. (The Lucene side is still the same, so it doesn't speed up
  total indexing time in normal circumstances though).
