- A multilanguage_support property is introduced on the catalog, defaulting
  to "True". If set to "False" this skips trying to find all language versions
  of a proxy an unindex them. This significantly speeds up reindexing.
  Also, when manage_reindexProxies this property is always turned off, as
  all language versions will be reindexed anyway.
