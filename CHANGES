New internal features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Now turns of asynchronous indexing when reindexing all proxies.
  Speeds up the zope side significantly, especially for single-field 
  indexing. (The Lucene side is still the same, so it doesn't speed up
  total indexing time in normal circumstances though).
- There is two implementations of the synchronize method, one that uses hasUID
  and one that does an empty search to get all documents and fetches the uid
  from these. On a small site, the last one is much faster, but both are
  included so that we can test them on a actual big site. The faster one will 
  then be permanent.
