  If you're looking for a tool to manage your Lucene store check out
  <a href="http://www.getopt.org/luke/">luke</a>.

  Luke is a handy development and diagnostic tool, which accesses
  already existing Lucene indexes and allows you to display and modify
  their contents in several ways:

  Though, you can perform some actions on the store from CPS on this
  page. See below.

<p>

<h3>Synchronization of documents and index</h3>

<p>Functions for synchronizing the content and the index, to make sure that
all documents are indexed, and no documents that have been deleted are still
in the index.</p> 

<p>(Advanced usage tip: This method will write INFO-level messages in the log
about how many documents that aren't indexed and how many documents that are
defunct. You can get this information from the logs without actuallydoing
anything by not selecting any action.)</p> 

<form action="manage_synchronize" method="POST">
<table border=0 cellspacing="5"><tr>
<td><input type="checkbox" id="remove_defunct" name="remove_defunct"/></td>
<td><label for="remove_defunct">Remove defunct entries: </label></td>
<td>
Goes through the whole index, and removes any entries where the objects
no longer exist in the ZODB.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><input type="checkbox" id="index_missing" name="index_missing"/></td>
<td><label for="index_missing">Index missing entries: </label></td>
<td>Indexes any document in the ZODB which is not in the index.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<input type="submit" name="SUBMIT" value="Synchronize"/>
</form>


<h3>Reindex document proxies</h3>

<p> Here you can specify a path to reindex. The path must be relative to the
portal (i.e. sections/projects, not /cps/sections/projects or
http://site.com/sections/projects).</p>

<p>If you specify a document that document will be reindexed. If you specify 
a folder, the folder and all documents and folders under that path will be
reindexed. If you leave the path empty, all document proxies will be
reindexed.</p>

<p>Reindexing the whole site might be useful while upgrading to a CPS Lucene
Catalog from a former zcatalog based instance. Be aware that this operation
might be a bit long depending of the size of your existing instance. </p>

<form action="manage_reindexProxies" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="from_path" value="" />
  <input type="submit" name="reindex" value="Reindex all"/>
</form>

<h3>Empty the whole indexes store</h3>
<p>
You can clear all the indexes from the server store from here.
</p>

<strong>Clicking here will remove all the indexes from store !</strong>

<br/>

<form action="manage_clean" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="clean" value="Clean the store"/>
</form>

<h3>Optimize the indexes store</h3>

<p> You can optimize the indexes store here. This is the standard Lucene
optimize feature. Note that optimization is done after most of the above
actions, so you probably don't need to do it. </p>

<form action="manage_optimize" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="optimize" value="Optimize indexes"/>
</form>
