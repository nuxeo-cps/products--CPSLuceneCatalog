  If you're looking for a tool to manage your Lucene store check out
  <a href="http://www.getopt.org/luke/">luke</a>.

  Luke is a handy development and diagnostic tool, which accesses
  already existing Lucene indexes and allows you to display and modify
  their contents in several ways:

  Though, you can perform some actions on the store from CPS on this
  page. See below.

<p>

<h3>Reindex the whole site</h3>

<p>
Reindexing the whole site might be useful while upgrading to a CPS
Lucene Catalog from a former zcatalog based instance. Be aware that
this operation might be a bit long depending of the size of your
existing instance.
</p>

<form action="manage_reindexProxies" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="reindex" value="Reindex all"/>
</form>

<h3>Optimize the indexes store</h3>

<p>
You can optimize the indexes store here. This is the standard Lucene
optimize feature.
</p>

<form action="manage_optimize" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="optimize" value="Optimize indexes"/>
</form>

<h3>Clean the whole indexes store</h3>
<p>
You can clear all the indexes from the server store from here.
</p>

<strong>Clicking here will remove all the indexes from store !</strong>

<br/>

<form action="manage_clean" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="clean" value="Clean the store"/>
</form>

<h3>Synchronize</h3>
<p>
Goes through the whole index, and removes any entries where the objects
no longer exist in the ZODB, and adds any document in the ZODB which is not
in the index.
</p>
<form action="manage_synchronizeEntries" method="POST">
  <input type="submit" name="synchronize" value="Synchronize entries"/>
</form>
