<p class="form-help"> 
This list defines what fields the lucene server will use to store
object content.  When objects get cataloged, the values of any
attributes which match an field in this list will get indexed using
the corresponding configuration.
</p>

<p class="form-help"> 
<b>
  If you add fields to a CPS Lucene Catalog which contains indexed
  objects, you MUST at the least re-index your newly added fields. You
  may want to update the whole CPS Lucene Catalog.

</p>

<p>About the field properties.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Keyword : </b>The data is stored and indexed but not
  tokenized. This is most useful for data that should be stored
  unchanged such as a date. In fact, the Field.Keyword can take a Date
  object as input.</li>

  <li><b>Text : </b> The data is stored, indexed, and
  tokenized. Field.Text fields should not be used for large amounts of
  data such as the article itself because the index will get very
  large since it will contain a full copy of the article plus the
  tokenized version.</li>

  <li><b>UnStored : </b> The data is not stored but it is indexed and
  tokenized. Large amounts of data such as the text of the article
  should be placed in the index unstored.</li>

  <li><b>UnIndexed :</b> The data is stored but not indexed or
  tokenized. This is used with data that you want returned with the
  results of a search but you won't actually be searching on this
  data. In our example, since we won't allow searching for the URL
  there is no reason to index it but we want it returned to us when a
  search result is found. </li>
