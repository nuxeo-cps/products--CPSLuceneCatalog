If you are just migrating from a ZCatalog based solution toward
CPSLuceneCatalog then you will need to reindex all the content of your
instance in Lucene.

To do that the CPS Catalog Tool provides an API called :
manage_reindexProxies()

You can invoke it using a wget for instance to avoid timeouts. Below
is an example of such a command :

$ wget --timeout=0 --http-user=admin --http-passwd=xxx http://localhost:8180/cps/portal_catalog/manage_reindexProxies

Of course, you need to provide the credentials of a user having
Manager rights on the CPS instance.

Note, this operation can be prerty long depending on the amount of
proxies living within your CPS instance and as well the size of the
SearchableText.

The Lucene index store will be optimized after the reindexation's done.
